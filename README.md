# 📱 SMS Spam Classifier 🚫

This project is a machine learning-based **SMS spam detection system** that classifies text messages as either **Spam** or **Ham (Not Spam)** using natural language processing (NLP) and supervised learning models.

## 🔍 Project Overview

SMS spam is one of the most common and annoying forms of digital spam. This classifier aims to **automate the detection of spam messages** using text-based features and ML models trained on real-world data.
